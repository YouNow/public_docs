## Our Philosophy

The Trust & Safety team uses a combination of automated systems and manual monitoring to ensure that all members of the YouNow community are kept safe. Guided by our [Community Standards & Site Rules](http://www.younow.com/siterules.php) and [Terms of Service](http://www.younow.com/terms.php), we continuously monitor YouNow broadcasts to warn, suspend, or ban any users who violate our policies.

## Tools To Stay Safe on YouNow

_Blocking a User_

On YouNow, any user can block any other user from contacting him or her. Simply use the drop down menu (on web) or click the user's name (on mobile) of the offending user's profile and find the option to "block".

Blocking a user prohibits that user from chatting in your broadcasts, private messaging you, or posting on your YouNow profile.

_Flagging a User_

Do your part! All users should flag any content that he or she believes violates YouNow's policies, or puts any member of the community at risk.

When you flag a user, the flag goes to a live moderator in real time who will review the situation and take action immediately as he or she sees fit. Please only flag content that you deem to be inappropriate! Repetitive false flagging on content that is not inappropriate could result in a short suspension.

_Contact a Mod_

Use the "[Contact Mod](https://younow.wufoo.com/forms/contact-a-younow-moderator/)" form on YouNow's website to submit your request for a moderator's attention. This form allows you to create a more in-depth report to a moderator in real-time.

## Underage Users

YouNow users must be at least thirteen years of age. If you are a user who comes in contact with a user who is under the age of thirteen, please make sure to flag the user (reason: "User under 13").

## Sexual Content

As per YouNow's official policies, sexually explicit content is not allowed on our service. If you come across an image or broadcast that is explicitly sexual or pornographic in nature, please flag the user immediately so a moderator can review the content and handle the situation accordingly.

Broadcasting, sharing, downloading, or encouraging sexually explicit content of minors can be criminal. Note that we report all instances of child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. For more information on reporting to NCMEC, [please click here](http://www.missingkids.com/CyberTipline).

## Broadcasting Safety Tips

It's important to maintain your privacy and security while broadcasting live. Below are a few tips we recommend you keep in mind while on YouNow, and on the Internet and social media, in general.

- Don't share personal information. We all love YouNow because we can connect with friends from all corners of the world, but sharing personal information publicly (including phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, etc.) can open unwanted communications. We strongly discourage you from sharing this sensitive information online with people you don't know.&nbsp;
- Don't click unrecognizable links. In the chat, users may share URLs that link to inappropriate or phishing websites. We ask that you flag the users posting such URLs, and make sure not to click them!&nbsp;
- Don't do anything online that you wouldn't want your parents seeing. YouNow is a public place, like any other. Parents, friends, teachers, or others you know might be watching, and so you should behave accordingly.&nbsp;
- Remember that everything you do gets recorded. After you end your broadcast, the recorded video lives on your profile for 3 days, or is permanent if it's your most recent broadcast. You do, however, have the ability to remove any video from your profile by navigating to the "broadcasts" tab.&nbsp;
